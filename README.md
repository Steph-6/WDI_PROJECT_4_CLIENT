#Project 4 - VeNew
#####- still in development

***
###Overview
For my intial concept I knew I wanted to explore the relationships that can be created with Ruby on Rails - so at least three models. I wanted to create a social network between bars and musicians to make small venues and bars more accessible to unsigined artists.

###Wins

The definite win was how well we worked as a team. Being so orgainised and communicating always we had probably three conflicts on Git, and no tme wasted arguing about ideas. Instead we decided upon a clear MVP and any ideas a team member had would be added to the Trello board. Then when MVP was achieved we coud ...order... which feature to add.
