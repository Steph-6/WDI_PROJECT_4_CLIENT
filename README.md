#Project 4 - VeNew
#####- still in development

***
###Overview
For my intial concept I knew I wanted to explore the relationships that can be created with Ruby on Rails - so at least three models. I wanted to create a social network between bars and musicians to make small venues and bars more accessible to unsigined artists.

###Intial Concept - MVP  
#####User Journey
A bar registers their details, in their profile they will be able to add a time slot.  
When a musician logs in they will can see all the registered venues.  
On that venue show page they can then see the information the venue registered with, a map with their location and any upcoming events.  
If the event is not at full capacity and the musician has not reached their maximum amount of pending requests, then they will be able to request that slot.  
When the venue logs back in, on their profile they willbe able to see in their upsomin

explain about adding spotify to the profile  
see the available time slots

###Building upon MVP
adding soundcloud  
adding google maps
autocomplete

###Wins

The definite win was how well we worked as a team. Being so orgainised and communicating always we had probably three conflicts on Git, and no tme wasted arguing about ideas. Instead we decided upon a clear MVP and any ideas a team member had would be added to the Trello board. Then when MVP was achieved we coud ...order... which feature to add.
